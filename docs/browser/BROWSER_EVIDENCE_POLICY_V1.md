# Browser Evidence Policy V1

Browser evidence records must be synthetic and include an artifact hash. Evidence proves contract evaluation only, not real capture.
No screenshot or browser trace from an external website is produced in this stage.

## Safety Boundary

- no send in this session;
- all outgoing messages are draft-only;
- forms are preview-only, no submit;
- Telegram is reserve channel only;
- social channels are contract-only;
- browser actions are contract-only;
- no Playwright runtime installed;
- no real voice capture;
- no STT/TTS provider;
- risky actions require screen approval;
- STOP blocks outbound/browser/voice/payment/production writes;
- future send requires owner approval with payload hash.
