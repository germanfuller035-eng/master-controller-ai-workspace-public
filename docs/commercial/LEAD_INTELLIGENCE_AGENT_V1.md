# Lead Intelligence Agent V1


Commercial Agent Factory V1 is draft/no-send only. It uses local synthetic fixtures, deterministic scoring, and saved evidence. It does not send email, social messages, forms, publications, invoices, payments, browser actions, real lead scraping, CRM writes, production DB writes, production deployment, Qdrant, Docling, crawler, or external MCP runtime.

Every factual claim requires evidence. Unsupported claims are blocked by QA / Red Team. Every future channel action requires owner approval before any send or publish step. COMMERCIAL_DRAFT remains OFF in production; OUTBOUND_EMAIL, OUTBOUND_SOCIAL, AUTO_SAFE, PRODUCTION_DB_WRITE, and PAYMENTS remain OFF.

The Lead Intelligence Agent accepts only synthetic fixture candidates. It records source type, lead id, and deterministic fingerprint. It cannot scrape, crawl, browse, enrich from external services, or write to CRM. Entry fails unless the lead is clearly synthetic and local.
